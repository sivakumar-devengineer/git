$ git init
    The command git init is used to initialize a new Git repository.
    It creates a new subdirectory named .git in your project folder.
    This .git folder contains all the metadata and objects that Git uses to track the history of your project.
commands:
===========
$ git status -->  Show the current state of the working directory and staging area

$ git add <file> --> 	Add file(s) to the staging area
$ git add .	 --> Stage all modified files
$ git commit -m "message"	-->  Commit staged changes with a message
$ git log	--> Show commit history
$ git remote -v	--> Show remote repositories
$ git push	--> Push changes to a remote repository
$ git pull	--> Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository
$ git fetch	--> Download changes from remote but donâ€™t merge yet

$ git push -u origin master --> 
    This command uploads your local commits from the master branch to the remote repository
    -u: Sets the upstream tracking relationship

    What -u (or --set-upstream) does:
    It links your local branch to the remote branch, so that in the future, you can simply use:
    $ git push
