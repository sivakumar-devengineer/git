git merge – Combine branches by creating a new merge commit
    git merge takes the contents of one branch and merges them into another branch (usually your current branch).
    
    It preserves the history of both branches.
    
    It creates a new merge commit if there are new commits on both branches.

git rebase – Reapply commits on top of another branch
    takes the commits from your current branch and re-applies them on top of another branch.

    It rewrites commit history.

    It creates new commits that look like your changes were made after the latest commit in the target branch.
